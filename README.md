### Easily control your home automations using hand gestures, at any time. This app recognizes the gestures using your security camera footage and controls every IoT action you can dream of. Nothing is impossible - make your life feel like you were the main character of a sci-fi movie.

Imagine living in a world where you can effortlessly control **every aspect of your smart home with a simple wave of your hand**. Welcome to Handy, a groundbreaking project designed to transform your daily life into a science fiction dream come true. With Handy, you can seamlessly interact with your home automation systems using hand gestures, making the future of smart living a reality today.

# Features

**üñêÔ∏è Gesture Recognition**

Control your smart home devices effortlessly with **various hand gestures** - I built and trained a classifier (Random Forest) model by myself. It gets the angles between different body joints (thanks to [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) and some magic (math to be specific)) as input data and outputs the corresponding gesture ID. This sophisticated model **accurately interprets your hand movements, enabling seamless interaction with your IoT devices**.

**üè° Home Assistant Integration**

Handy was built to seamlessly integrate with [**Home Assistant**](https://www.home-assistant.io/), the most popular central hub for your smart home ecosystem. This means you can effortlessly control all your IoT devices that are compatible with it. Every single one of them. There is no catch.

**üéµ Built-In actions**

The core element of Handy is **music control** - play, pause, adjust volume, switch tracks, play music from YouTube or online radio, and much more. Want to get an update on **weather** or want the music player to **say the current date and time**? No problem at all.

üì± **Mobile App**

If you need to **manually control Handy without using hand gestures**, you can use the mobile app I also created. What's more, it keeps **the action history** so that you can see who did what and when. You can also **manage music items** (radios/YouTube videos) of the playlist used in Handy.

**‚öôÔ∏è Resource Efficiency**

Efficiently operates on **standard surveillance cameras 24/7**, without any problems. Optimized for **fully automated workflow** - you forget that this app "works somewhere" - these hand gestures become a crucial part of your life (trust me, I know what I'm talking about üòÖ)

**ü§ñ Customization**

The app can be customized in every way. You can even build, train, and test your own gesture recognition model - I wanted this project to be **incredibly friendly** for new users - see below for Jupyter notebooks on how to get started. Easily customize and extend actions for any IoT device - with the intuitive code and docs.

**üìà Constant Innovation**

Since this is a crucial part of my (and my family members') lives right now, every problem that I discover will be patched. And of course, **this doesn't stop just there**. This app will be improved so that it becomes a real science fiction dream come true.

# Prerequirements

- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

**IMPORTANT:** Before using the app, please upload the audio from the /handy/audio/ directory to Home Assistant as local media.

# Train

Handy comes with pretrained model that recognizes various of hand gestures, but if you want to build your own, please follow the notebooks below.

1. [Gather data](./handy/train/0_Gather_Data.ipynb)

1. [Process data](./handy/train/1_Process_Data.ipynb)

1. [Train model](./handy/train/2_Train_Model.ipynb)

After completing all above, you can optionally:

1. [Select ROI (region of interest), T-ROI (trigger region of interest), and G-ROI (gesture region of interest)](./handy/utils/Select_ROI.ipynb)

1. [Test model](./handy/train/3_Test_Model.ipynb)

# Const values

You can modify some of the preferences a by creating a `config.json` file (`handy/config.json`)

## Required changes:

- STREAM_URL - the URL of the camera video feed - stream
- HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN - your [Home Assistant long-lived access token](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token)

## Optional changes:

- FPS_IDLE - frames per second before detection
- FPS - frames per second after detection for gesture recognition
- RESIZE_WIDTH - resize your input image to that width
- RESIZE_HEIGHT - resize your input image to that height
- ENV - change the current running environment - "DEV" or "PROD"
- HOME_ASSISTANT_IP - the URL of your Home Assistant instance. Important: don't put the slash at the end
- MEDIA_PLAYER_HASS_ENTITY_ID - the entity id of the media player inside Home Assistant - used for audio playing (e.g. confirmation of gesture)
- DETECTIONS_TO_KEEP - To prevent false detections caused by accidental gestures or model inaccuracy, Handy caches the last detections. This variable sets the number of detections to store.
- MINIMAL_DETECTIONS - that number of DETECTIONS_TO_KEEP has to be the same to consider a detection as true (and perform the given action)
- ACTION_BLOCK_DELAY_SECONDS - to prevent user from accidently performing the same action after they show the gesture and didn't manage to stop showing it, add some blocking delay between next action
- FAST_MODE_DURATION_SECONDS - normally the app works in an idle mode on low FPS. When user enters the T-ROI or a gesture within G-ROI is detected, the app turns into fast mode with high FPS. This variable determines how long it should remain in the fast mode after the last movement.
- REQUIRED_TROI_PERCENT_CHANGE - this amount of the T-ROI frame has to be different for Handy to consider a movement inside it. Unit is percent [%].
- NUMERIC_VALUE_MAX_WAITING_TIME_SECONDS - there are some actions, like changing volume, that have to know the numeric value of change (see `numeric_value_track` in `numeric_value_track.py`). This value determines how many seconds user can stand without raising neither of their arms to be considered as idle (so cancel the action)
- GET_NUMERIC_VALUE_INTERVAL_SECONDS - see above - the handler will be called every n seconds, where n is this value.
- LANGUAGE - can be either "pl" or "en" - the announcements will be said in that language, e.g. the current time.
- MIN_ARM_ANGLE_FOR_NUMERIC_VALUE_CHANGE - Minimum angle for arm to be considered as raised (which, in numeric vaule mode, causes the value to be either increased or decreased).
- TIME_START_MINUTES_AFTER_MIDNIGHT - The time of the day that Handy starts processing the images at (to prevent it from unnecessary image processing, e.g. why would it process images at 2 am?). It's minutes after midnight, i.e. hour \* 60 + minutes, e.g. 08:15 = 8 \* 60 + 15. Defaults to 8:00.
- TIME_END_MINUTES_AFTER_MIDNIGHT - The same thing as above, but it's ending time. Defaults to 21:00.
- SOCKET_IO_PORT - A port that the socket.io instance will run on.
- ACTION_PERFORMED_HISTORY_LENGTH - in the mobile app, you can view the recent performed actions. This variable determines how many of the recent actions should be kept.

## Action-related changes

- PLAYER_PLAYPAUSE_HASS_ENTITY_ID - this media_player entity will be used for play/pause action
- PLAYER_VOLUME_HASS_ENTITY_ID - this media_player entity will be used for volume change action
- PLAYER_NEXTPLAYLISTITEM_HASS_ENTITY_ID - this media_player entity will be used for playing next playlist item (see below for playlist)
- WEATHER_HASS_ENTITY_ID - this weather entity will be used for weather info

# Using with Volumio

If you want to use Handy with [**Volumio**](https://volumio.com/en/get-started/) (like I do), you have to note that there's a huge difference between the [**Volumio integration in Home Assistant**](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/volumio/) and [**MPD**](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mpd/) (it's not the same as [**DLNA Digital Media Renderer**](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/dlna_dmr/) - this one is useless and buggy for Volumio).

You should use both [Volumio](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/volumio/) and [MPD](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mpd/) integration. The first one is good for just controlling Volumio, whereas the second one is required to get current played media or play something on Volumio. See the default config - `media_player.volumio` is the Volumio integration and `media_player.mpd` is the Music Player Daemon (which is still Volumio). The MPD is a perfect thing - it comes back to the previously played media when using TTS (announce mode) - which is just ideal for Handy and solves tones of unnecessary problems DLNA_DMR or Volumio has.

To set up MPD in Home Assistant, please add:

```yaml
- platform: mpd
  name: volumio_mpd
  host: your.volumio.ip.address
```
